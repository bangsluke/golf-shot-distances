### Step 1: Clone the Repository

1. **Fork the repository** (if it's public) or create a new repository on GitHub
2. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/golf-shot-distances.git
   cd golf-shot-distances
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Verify installation**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - You should see a development server starting
   - The app will open in your browser (though it won't have data yet)

### Step 2: Set Up Google Sheets

1. **Create a new Google Sheet**:
   - Go to [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com/)
   - Create a new spreadsheet
   - Name it something like "Golf Shot Distances"

2. **Set up the data structure**:
   - In the first row, add these headers:
     ```
     Club | Average Flat Carry (Yards) | Average Roll (Yards) | Overhit Risk (Yards) | Average Total Distance Hit (Yards) | Notes
     ```
   - Add your club data. Here's an example structure:
     ```
     Driver | 250 | 20 | 15 | 270 | My driver with good contact
     3 Wood | 220 | 15 | 10 | 235 | Fairway wood for long approaches
     5 Iron | 180 | 10 | 8 | 190 | Mid-iron for approach shots
     7 Iron | 150 | 8 | 6 | 158 | Short iron for approach shots
     Putter | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | For putting only
     ```
   - **Note**: You can use data from a TopTracer driving range or any other golf tracking system
   - **Tip**: Make sure all numeric values are actually numbers, not text

3. **Get the Spreadsheet ID**:
   - Look at the URL of your Google Sheet
   - The ID is the long string between `/d/` and `/edit`
   - Example: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ABC123DEF456GHI789/edit#gid=0`
   - The ID would be: `1ABC123DEF456GHI789`
   - **Save this ID** - you'll need it later

### Step 3: Configure Google Cloud API

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project**:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Click "Select a project" → "New Project"
   - Name your project (e.g., "Golf Shot Distances")
   - Click "Create"
   - **Note**: Make sure to select the new project after creation

2. **Enable Google Sheets API**:
   - In your project, go to "APIs & Services" → "Library"
   - Search for "Google Sheets API"
   - Click on it and press "Enable"
   - Wait for the API to be enabled (you'll see a green checkmark)

3. **Create a Service Account**:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" → "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" → "Service Account"
   - Fill in the details:
     - Name: "Golf Shot Distances Service Account"
     - Description: "Service account for golf shot distances app"
   - Click "Create and Continue"
   - Skip the optional steps and click "Done"

4. **Generate Service Account Key**:
   - Click on your newly created service account
   - Go to the "Keys" tab
   - Click "Add Key" → "Create new key"
   - Choose "JSON" format
   - Click "Create"
   - The JSON file will download automatically
   - **Important**: Keep this file secure and don't share it

5. **Share the Google Sheet**:
   - Open your Google Sheet
   - Click "Share" (top right)
   - Add the service account email (found in the JSON file under `client_email`)
   - Give it "Editor" permissions
   - Click "Send"
   - **Verify**: The service account email should appear in the sharing list

### Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables

1. **For Local Development**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
     ```env
     VITE_GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY={"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project-id",...}
     VITE_GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID=your-spreadsheet-id-here
     ```
   - Replace the values with your actual data:
     - Copy the entire content of your downloaded JSON file for `VITE_GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`
     - Use your spreadsheet ID for `VITE_GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID`
   - **Important**: Make sure there are no extra spaces or line breaks in the JSON

2. **For Netlify Deployment** (we'll set this up later):
   - You'll add these same variables in the Netlify dashboard

3. **Add .env to .gitignore** (if not already there):
   - Check that `.env` is listed in your `.gitignore` file
   - This prevents your sensitive data from being committed to Git

> [Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Step 5: Test Your Setup

1. **Test Local Development**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Open your browser to the development server
   - Check the browser console for any errors
   - The app should load and display your golf club data

2. **Test Data Loading**:
   - If data doesn't load, check:
     - Browser console for errors
     - That your `.env` file is in the root directory
     - That the service account has access to the spreadsheet
     - That the spreadsheet ID is correct

3. **Test Data Updates** (if the app supports editing):
   - Try updating a club's distance
   - Check that the changes appear in your Google Sheet

> [Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Step 6: Deploy to GitHub

1. **Initialize Git** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

2. **Create a new repository on GitHub**:
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/)
   - Click "New repository"
   - Name it "golf-shot-distances"
   - Make it public or private (your choice)
   - Don't initialize with README (since you already have one)
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/golf-shot-distances.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. **Verify the push**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - You should see all your files there
   - **Important**: Make sure `.env` is NOT in the repository (it should be ignored)

   - Add the following variables:
     ```
     GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY = {"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project-id",...}
     GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID = your-spreadsheet-id-here
     ```
   - Use the same values from your local `.env` file
   - **Important**: Make sure to use the exact same format as your local `.env` file

4. **Redeploy**:
   - Go to "Deploys" tab
   - Click "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"
   - Wait for the deployment to complete

5. **Test the Live Site**:
