# Deployment Guide for Golf Shot Distances App

## Prerequisites

1. **Google Sheets API Setup**
   - Create a Google Cloud Project
   - Enable Google Sheets API
   - Create a Service Account
   - Download the service account JSON key

2. **Google Spreadsheet**
   - Create a Google Spreadsheet with your club data
   - Share the spreadsheet with your service account email

## Environment Variables Setup

### For Netlify Deployment

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Navigate to your site's settings
3. Go to "Environment variables"
4. Add the following variables:

```
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY={"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project-id",...}
GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID=your-spreadsheet-id-here
```

### Important Notes:

- **GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY**: This should be the entire JSON content of your service account key file
- **GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID**: This is the long string in your Google Sheets URL between `/d/` and `/edit`

## Google Sheets Setup

Your spreadsheet should have the following structure:

| Club | Average Flat Carry (Yards) | Average Roll (Yards) | Overhit Risk (Yards) | Average Total Distance Hit (Yards) | ... |
|------|---------------------------|---------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|-----|
| Driver | 250 | 240 | 20 | 260 | ... |
| 3 Wood | 220 | 210 | 15 | 230 | ... |

   - Ensure the service account has the correct permissions
   - Verify the JSON key is not corrupted

3. **Spreadsheet Access Issues**
